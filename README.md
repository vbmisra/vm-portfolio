# vm-portfolio
* As a developer, I created a website that will serve as a portfolio to highlight my skills and featured projects. The website is currently a work in progress, but the basic skeleton is laid out.

## About the Project
This project lays the foundation for my portfolio that will be featured to recruiters and hiring managers within the tech industry. Once complete, it will highlight the major projects I have worked on. It will also provide relevant information such as my contact info, resume and background information about me.
